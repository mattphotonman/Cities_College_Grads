Cities_College_Grads
====================

This is an attempt at trying to explain the observed distribution of college graduates in some American cities.  Within the framework of the model, it is possible to tell whether there is a clustering effect, i.e. college grads tend to go to cities with other college grads, or whether the distribution is consistent with college grads moving to cities at random.  This project is in response to the following article: http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/05/31/us/education-in-metro-areas.html
